# CS7641_ML_P2
Machine Learning Project 2

This repo can be cloned by running "git clone https://github.com/ajscott0613/CS7641_ML_P2.git"

The requirements.txt file can be installed via the command line by running "pip install -r requirments" and contains the necessary packages and version to run the python files.

Each of the files noted in the instructions section can be ran individial by running "python3 DT.py" or all files can be ran by running "python3 *.py"

## File Contents

DiscreteAlg.py: This file contains the code necessary to generate plots and data for the Random Hill Climbing, Simualted Annealing, Genetic Algorithm, and MIMIC optimziation algorithms for three different discrete problem spaces.  This cod ewith output four png files that include plots for each problem space (12 total plots).

NNTuning.py:  This file contains the code needed to train the weights in a nueral network using Gradient Descent, Random Hill Climbing, Simualted Annealing, and Genetic Algorithms.

utils.py: contains support functions for plotting.

opt_problems.py:  contains the code for different discrete problem spaces.

winequality-red.csv: Wine data set used for neural network classificaiton and tuning.

requirements.txt: contains the packages needed to run the files

## Instructions

The file DiscreteAlg.py can be ran by running "python DiscreteAlg.py" in the command line.

The file NNTuning can be ran directly by running "python NNTuning.py" directly in the command line.
