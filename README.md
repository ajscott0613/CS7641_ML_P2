Machine Learning Project 2

## File Contents

DiscreteAlg.py: This file contains the code necessary to generate plots and data for the Random Hill Climbing, Simualted Annealing, Genetic Algorithm, and MIMIC optimziation algorithms for three different discrete problem spaces.  This cod ewith output four png files that include plots for each problem space (12 total plots).

NNTuning.py:  This file contains the code needed to train the weights in a nueral network using Gradient Descent, Random Hill Climbing, Simualted Annealing, and Genetic Algorithms.

utils.py: contains support functions for plotting.

opt_problems.py:  contains the code for different discrete problem spaces.

winequality-red.csv: Wine data set used for neural network classificaiton and tuning.

## Instructions



The file DiscreteAlg.py can be ran by running "python DiscreteAlg.py" in the command line.

The file NNTuning can be ran directly by running "python NNTuning.py" directly in the command line.
